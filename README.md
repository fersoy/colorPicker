# colorPicker
An activity to learn RGB colors better and a good practise to use DOM monupulation. 

Usage:

RGB color system has three main colors. In turn(!); Red, Green and Blue. The color tons start from 1 to 255. In the css files you will see these 3 numbers in a parentheses such as rgb(223, 123, 012). That means the color we will get as a result is something close to red because first number 223 represent red and it is the highest number. So, basically we will try to guess the number has been given in our RGB parentheses.
